Below are projects selected to match **Research Scientist (Causal Inference + ML)** roles: problem framing, clean methodology, and decision relevance.

## 1) Causal Inference: Estimating Treatment Effects (template)
::: {.project-card}
**Goal.** Estimate the causal impact of an intervention (e.g., a feature rollout or creator program) on an outcome metric.

**What I show.**
- Causal graph (DAG) and identification assumptions  
- Estimation (e.g., propensity scores, doubly robust / DML)  
- Sensitivity analysis and robustness checks  
- “So what?” section: what decision changes

**Artifacts.**
- Notebook: `projects/causal_ate.ipynb` (add your link)  
- Short write-up: `posts/causal-inference-dags.qmd`

## 2) Music market analysis using Spotify Web API (MSc thesis)
::: {.project-card}
**Goal.** Identify audio + market patterns associated with “hit” outcomes and translate them into decision support for record labels.

**What I show.**
- Data collection via Spotify Web API  
- Supervised + unsupervised ML (feature engineering, evaluation)  
- Practical interpretation for A&R / marketing decisions

**Artifacts.**
- Repo / report link: <ADD_LINK>
:::

## 3) Open-source: PEAXAI (R package) (if public)
::: {.project-card}
**Goal.** Provide reproducible tools for probabilistic efficiency analysis + explainability.

**What I show.**
- Package docs + examples  
- Testing / CI (optional)  
- Reproducibility principles

**Artifacts.**
- CRAN / GitHub link: <ADD_LINK>

### Tips (to keep it “Spotify style”)
- One paragraph per project: **problem → method → result → decision**  
- Prefer 2–4 strong projects over many weak ones  
- Link to **code + a 1-page explanation** (PDF or post)
