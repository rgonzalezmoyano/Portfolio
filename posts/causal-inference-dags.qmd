## The goal
When a metric changes, we want to know **whether an intervention caused it**, not just whether it correlates.

## A minimal DAG workflow
1) Define treatment **T**, outcome **Y**, and pre-treatment covariates **X**  
2) Draw a DAG capturing your assumptions  
3) Identify a valid adjustment set  
4) Estimate the effect (e.g., DR / DML)  
5) Stress-test assumptions (sensitivity)

## What I’d report to a product team
- Estimated effect size + uncertainty  
- What assumptions are required  
- What could break the conclusion  
- Recommended decision (and safe next experiment)
