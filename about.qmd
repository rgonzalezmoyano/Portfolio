## Short bio

PhD candidate in Statistics, Optimization and Applied Mathematics (UMH). I work on ML methods that support transparent decision-making under uncertainty, with a particular interest in **causal inference** and **counterfactual recommendations**.

## What I’m looking for
A Research Scientist internship where I can build causal tools that help teams make better decisions, ideally in the intersection of creators, users, and product.
